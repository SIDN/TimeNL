            The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol'>Network Time Protocol</a> (NTP) ensures that computers on the internet can synchronize their system clocks, so that they are always right down to the millisecond. Stable and accurate time is essential for the proper functioning of all kinds of applications. Accurate time is crucial for determining the order in which events occur and is a fundamental aspect of transaction integrity, logging / audit, troubleshooting and forensic investigations.

An example of this is given above, but also consult the documentation for the relevant package, because there may be differences in detail. For example, <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/NTP.html">Ubuntu works with timesyncd</a>, which sometimes gets in the way when another NTP package is required. But, if you don't want another NTP package, adjusting timesyncd is simple. In short, this comes down to; edit <samp>/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf</samp>. See <samp>man timesyncd.conf</samp>. There is a lot of information about this on the internet. And with OpenNTPD <samp>weight</samp> is used insted of <samp>prefer</samp>.</p>
              <p class="text-justify">Another option is not to work with a daemon, but to synchronize your server with some regularity from CRON. In the example below, this happens weekly (at a fairly random time, not at minute '0', in order to avoid overload peaks), but more often of course is also allowed.

              <p class="text-justify"><strong>Answer:</strong> In short; because it fits in with our role.<br>
                <a href="https://www.sidnlabs.nl/over-sidnlabs">SIDN Labs</a> is the research team of <a href="https://www.sidn.nl/thema/over-sidn">SIDN</a>. As a team we stand for the improvement and further security and innovation of the internet. We actively contribute to this. As the administrator of the .nl country domain, we have a reputation to uphold. We ensure that everyone, always, can reach the .nl domain names under our management on the basis of DNS (Domain Name System). We regard the worldwide availability of more than 5.8 million .nl domain names as a top priority that we take very seriously. That is why we have invested heavily in knowledge, expertise and a sound infrastructure. We have extensive experience with this so-called <a href="https://english.wrr.nl/publications/reports/2015/10/01/the-public-core-of-the-internet">'public core of the internet'</a>, which includes DNS. In our opinion, (public) NTP is also, in a sense, such an infrastructure service. And setting it up, maintaining it and making it available free of charge to the internet community is in line with our vision and really up our alley. We think that our experience and knowledge will be of great help in better putting the importance of NTP on the map. For that reason we make this service available free of charge and free of charge to everyone with the same passion and quality that you are used to from us for .nl and our other services.

                <strong>Dutch internet time service?</strong><br>
                As a registry of the .nl country domain, we are naturally quite proud of TimeNL and regard that as the (albeit unofficial) 'Dutch internet time service', as you can find in <a href="https://www.npl.co.uk/products-services/time-frequency/internet-time">the United Kingdom</a>,<a href="https://ntp.net.nz/">New Zealand</a>, <a href="http://www.ntp.se/">Sweden</a>, <a href="https://betime.be/nl/">Belgium</a>, <a href="https://www.ptb.de/cms/ptb/fachabteilungen/abtq/gruppe-q4/ref-q42/zeitsynchronisation-von-rechnern-mit-hilfe-des-network-time-protocol-ntp.html">Germany</a> and <a href="https://www.nist.gov/pml/time-and-frequency-division/services/internet-time-service-its">the United States</a>.

          <button class="btn btn-dark" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" id="slaquestion" data-target="#sla"><strong>Question:</strong> What service levels can I expect?</button>
          <div id="sla" class="collapse">
            <div class="alert alert-dark">
              <p class="text-justify"><strong>Answer:</strong> We have done our best to set up a reliable and reliable NTP service.</p>
              <p class="text-justify">You can expect us to make an effort to offer and maintain a good quality NTP service. We invest in knowledge and expertise, in infrastructure, in safety, in modern versions of software, in support of new standards, in sufficient capacity and in quality monitoring. The basic service is free and available to everyone, both via IPv4 and IPv6. If you want more, for example 'authenticated NTP', then that is negotiable, but we can possibly ask for compensation for this. That choice is ours.</p>
              <p class="text-justify">Of course we keep a finger on the pulse regarding abuse [*]. We will not tolerate that. We therefore reserve the right to deny you access to the service in whole or in part through filtering or rate limiting. We also do everything we can to prevent abuse, both technically and legally.</p>
              <p class="text-justify">Furthermore, we accept no liability whatsoever for not being able to use our service (properly). You use TimeNL at your own risk and therefore also have your own responsibility. Therefore, make sure that you do not rely solely on our NTP service where necessary, but, for example, set up 2 third-party NTP services in your own stratum. If you have any questions, we are happy to advise you. Incidentally, it is quite possible that in time we will expand our capacity and offer several separate NTP servers that you can then rely on. We reserve the right to make changes to our service without prior notice. Of course, under normal circumstances we will communicate well in advance, via the <a href="https://mailman.sidn.nl/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/time-users">mailing list</a>, <a href="https://time.nl">this website</a> and/or via our <a href="https://twitter.com/sidnlabs">social media</a> channels.
              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">[*] We apply a fair-use policy. The default settings of most NTP software ensure that you remain well within our margins. Under normal circumstances, your systems do not need to approach us more than once per 30 minutes or thereabouts. Of course it is no problem if you, by way of exception, want to temporarily deviate from this. But don't overdo it.

                <strong>Answer:</strong> This is partly due to the company size. You can let all your users communicate with our NTP server. But with larger numbers of users, it can be useful to configure your own internal NTP server and let the users synchronize their time with it. We call this a so-called stratum 2 server. This can in turn synchronize the time with (among others) our stratum 1 server. That way our server is less burdened and you don't have to open your possible firewall for every user. In even larger environments, this can be extended even further to stratum 3. The figure shows how such a structure works.<br>
                <br>
                The yellow arrows indicate a direct link with a reference clock. Our stratum 1 server has those. The red arrows indicate a network connection (over the internet) with 'parent' servers. For example your stratum 2 or 3 server (s), which retrieve their time from (among others) our stratum 1 server (s).<br>
                <br>
                We also recommend that you subscribe to our <a href="https://mailman.sidn.nl/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/time-users">mailing list</a>, so that you are always informed when there are developments.<br>
                <br>
                It is usually a good idea <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8633#section-3.2">not to rely on a single NTP server</a> for time synchronization. Until we have expanded our server park, we recommend that you configure multiple NTP servers from other providers in the Netherlands. Such as (but not exclusively):
              <ul>
                <li><i class="fas fa-globe"></i> chime1.surfnet.nl</li>
                <li><i class="fas fa-atom"></i> time1.esa.int</li>
                <li><i class="fas fa-atom"></i> ntp.vsl.nl</li>
                <li><i class="fas fa-globe"></i> ntp.ripe.net</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                With symbols we indicate the probable (primary) reference clock of these systems, so <i class="fas fa-globe"></i> for <a href="https://www.gsa.europa.eu/european-gnss/what-gnss">GNSS</a> (ie GPS and no others as far as we know) and <i class="fas fa-atom"></i> for atomic clock. There are many more good NTP servers, both in the Netherlands and in the <a href="https://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/time_ann_rep/Time_annual_report_2017/23_timeservices_TAR17.pdf">neighboring countries</a>. So this was just a suggestion.

            <div class="alert alert-dark">
              <p class="text-justify"><strong>Answer:</strong> We have secured the domain name 'time.nl', under which we offer this service, through <a href="https://www.sidn.nl/veilig-internet/dnssec">DNSSEC</a>. If your system supports this, you can be confident that you will not be sent to the wrong IP address if you want to go to 'ntp.time.nl'. The correct time is also important for DNSSEC to function properly. In some situations this causes a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mglt-dnsop-dnssec-validator-requirements">chicken/egg problem</a> for example when systems without an embedded Real Time Clock (RTC) start up, do not yet have a sense of time (they think it is 1-1-1970), but still attempt to do DNSSEC validation to find the IP address of 'ntp.time.nl' (which then fails) <a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&m=156102757301757&w=2">Solutions</a> have already been devised for this, although it still remains a point of attention. For systems that are (roughly) synchronized in time, this is not a problem.

              <p class="text-justify"><strong>Answer:</strong> The standard (free and anonymous) public service does not have that. But authentication based on 'symmetric keys' is possible among registered users. Let us know if you need this and why. The decision as to whether we can subsequently offer this to you lies with us, as does the decision whether we will do this for free or for a small fee. We do set some requirements. For example, we do not use an <a href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8573'>MD5 algorithm</a> for our keys.

          <p class="text-justify">
            The NTP service TimeNL from SIDN Labs is a so-called stratum 1 server with different reference clocks, which themselves are very precise atomic clocks. We synchronize not only with the <a href="https://www.gps.gov/">American GPS system</a>, but also with the <a href="https://www.gsa.europa.eu/european-gnss/galileo/galileo-european-global-satellite-based-navigation-system">European Galileo GNSS</a>. That way we reduce dependence on an American system, which distinguishes us from many other NTP servers. As the first backup, we also synchronize to the <a href="https://radiopedia.nl/wiki/DCF77_(tijdseinzender)">German DCF077 radio signal</a>. And as a second backup, we are still synchronizing with atomic clocks in the Netherlands (including that of <a href="https://www.vsl.nl/en/technologies/time-and-frequency">VSL in Delft</a>) <!-- TODO toevoegen UTC(VSL) --> en Belgiium.  Our hardware (for enthusiasts: we use the <a href="https://www.meinbergglobal.com/english/360/#ims-lantime-m3000">M3000 from Meinberg</a>, which we affectionately call "Arnold", after the maker and nickname of the silver pocket watch from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Belville">Ruth Belville</a>) automatically ensures that the most accurate reference clock is always chosen. This server is accessible via both a good (multi-homed) internet connection via both IPv4 and IPv6. In this way we are able to offer very precise time synchronization to many users. Of course we already have plans for the future. We will increase the number of NTP servers, if we can thereby increase the reliability of our service, and possibly make them accessible via BGP anycast, as we did for the DNS servers of the .nl domain.
