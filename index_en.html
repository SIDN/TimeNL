            The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol'>Network Time Protocol</a> (NTP) enables internet-connected computers to synchronise their system clocks, so that they are always accurate to within a millisecond. Stable and accurate timing is vital for all kinds of applications to function properly. Precise timing is needed to decide what order a series of events happened in, for example. It's also a fundamental aspect of transaction integrity, logging, auditing, troubleshooting and forensic research.

They usually have an <samp>ntp.conf</samp> file (also sometimes called <samp>ntpd.conf</samp>) for configuring the NTP server. See the example above, but consult the documentation for the relevant package as well, because there may be minor differences. For instance, <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/NTP.html">Ubuntu works with timesyncd by default</a>, which sometimes gets in the way when you want to use another NTP package as well. However, if you don't want another NTP package, adjusting timesyncd is straightforward. It essentially involves editing <samp>/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf</samp>. See <samp>man timesyncd.conf</samp>. Further information is easy to find on the internet. With OpenNTPD <samp>weight</samp> is used insted of <samp>prefer</samp>.</p>
              <p class="text-justify">Another option is not to work with a daemon, but to periodically synchronise your server with CRON. In the example below, we have opted for weekly synchronisation (at a fairly random time, not at minute '0', in order to avoid overload peaks). However, you can of course synchronise more often if you wish. Do not synchronise more than once an hour, though, and not on the hour, but at a randomly chosen time.</p>

              <p class="text-justify"><strong>Answer:</strong> Because it fits in with our role.<br>
                <a href="https://www.sidnlabs.nl/over-sidnlabs">SIDN Labs</a> is <a href="https://www.sidn.nl/thema/over-sidn">SIDN</a>'s research team. As a team, we are strong advocates of internet improvement, security and innovation. And we actively contribute to realisation of those goals. As the administrator of the .nl country-code domain, we have a reputation to uphold. We ensure that the .nl domain names under our control are always universally reachable via the DNS (Domain Name System). The worldwide availability of the 5.8 million-plus .nl domain names is our top priority. We have therefore invested heavily in knowledge, expertise and robust infrastructure. We have extensive experience with the so-called <a href="https://english.wrr.nl/publications/reports/2015/10/01/the-public-core-of-the-internet">'public core of the internet'</a>, which the DNS is part of. We believe that (public) NTP may also be regarded as an infrastructure service. Setting up and maintaining an NTP service, and making it available free of charge to the internet community, is in line with our vision and a good fit with our other activities. We think that our experience and knowledge can really help to highlight the importance of NTP. We are therefore making this service freely available to everyone, for the good of the community. It will be delivered with the drive and commitment to quality that you are used to with .nl and our other services.

            <div class="alert alert-dark">
              <p class="text-justify"><strong>Answer:</strong> We have done our best to set up a reliable and reliable NTP service.</p>
              <p class="text-justify">You can expect us to make every reasonable effort to offer and maintain a good quality NTP service. We invest in knowledge and expertise, infrastructure, security, up-to-date software, support for modern standards, capacity and quality monitoring. The basic service is freely available to everyone, both using IPv4 and using IPv6. Specialist services such as authenticated NTP are available by arrangement. However, we may choose to charge for such services.</p>
              <p class="text-justify">Naturally, we keep an eye out for abuse,[*] which we are not prepared to tolerate. If you abuse the service, we may use filtering or rate limiting technology to restrict or block your access. We also do everything we can to prevent abuse by technical and legal means.</p>
              <p class="text-justify">Furthermore, if you are unable to make (full) use of our service, we accept no liability for the consequences. You use TimeNL at your own risk, and you accept personal responsibility for your use of the service. We accordingly advise you not to rely solely on our NTP service. Where appropriate, for example, you should set up two third-party NTP services within your own stratum. If you have any questions, we are happy to give advice. In due course, we may expand our capacity and offer several separate NTP servers, so that the service becomes fully dependable. We reserve the right to make changes to our service without notice. Normally, however, we will announce changes well in advance, using the <a href="https://mailman.sidn.nl/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/time-users">mailing list</a>, <a href="https://time.nl">this website</a> and/or our <a href="https://twitter.com/sidnlabs">social media</a> channels.
              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">[*] We operate a fair usage policy. The default settings in most NTP software will ensure that you remain well within the limits defined in that context, for example with a poll interval of 1024s. If you work via a cron job, an interval of 1 x per 30 minutes is probably more than sufficient. Under non-standard circumstances, it's okay to query our server more often for a while. But don't overdo it.

                <strong>Answer:</strong> That depends partly on how big your company is. One option is for all your users to communicate with our NTP server independently. However, if you have a lot of users, it may be better to configure your own internal NTP server and let individual users synchronise their time with it. In a set-up like that, your server is called a stratum 2 server. A stratum 2 server gets its time from one or more stratum 1 servers, such as ours. The advantages are that there is less load on our server, and, if you use a firewall, you don't have to open it for every user. In a very large environment, a third stratum can be added, as illustrated.<br>
                <br>
                The yellow arrows indicate direct links to reference clocks. Our stratum 1 server has links to reference clocks. The red arrows indicate network (i.e. internet) connections to 'parent' servers. Those connections enable your stratum 2 or 3 server(s) to retrieve their time from stratum 1 servers, including ours.<br>

                <br>
                It's usually a good idea <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8633#section-3.2">not to rely on a single NTP server</a> for time synchronization. Until we have expanded our server park, we recommend that you configure your system to use multiple NTP servers, including other Dutch servers. Here are some of the options:
              <ul>
                <li><i class="fas fa-globe"></i> chime1.surfnet.nl</li>
                <li><i class="fas fa-atom"></i> time1.esa.int</li>
                <li><i class="fas fa-atom"></i> ntp.vsl.nl</li>
                <li><i class="fas fa-globe"></i> ntp.ripe.net</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The symbol next to each server indicates the type of (primary) reference clock the system is likely to use: <i class="fas fa-globe"></i> represents <a href="https://www.gsa.europa.eu/european-gnss/what-gnss">GNSS</a> (exclusively GPS, as far as we know) and <i class="fas fa-atom"></i> represents an atomic clock. There are many more good NTP servers, both in the Netherlands and in <a href="https://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/time_ann_rep/Time_annual_report_2017/23_timeservices_TAR17.pdf">neighboring countries</a>. The ones listed above are only suggestions.

                <br>
                In the Netherlands and other countries, quality requirements have been or are being considered for time synchronisation. Requirements have also been made at the European level and by the Dutch Radiocommunications Agency. See, for example, <a href="https://www.agentschaptelecom.nl/binaries/agentschap-telecom/documenten/publicaties/2018/juli/19/etsi-ip-handover-interface/2017-11-22+ETSI-IP.nl+v4.0.pdf">paragraph 4.15 of this document</a>. . Those requirements can, of course, be met by using our NTP service.

            <div class="alert alert-dark">
              <p class="text-justify"><strong>Answer:</strong> The domain name used for this service, 'time.nl', is secured with <a href="https://www.sidn.nl/veilig-internet/dnssec">DNSSEC</a>. So, if your system supports DNSSEC, you can be confident that you won't be directed to a false IP address when you navigate to 'ntp.time.nl'. It's worth noting that accurate timing is needed for DNSSEC to work properly. So a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mglt-dnsop-dnssec-validator-requirements">chicken-and-egg problem</a> can sometimes arise. For instance, when a system without an embedded Real Time Clock (RTC) starts up, it may have no idea of the time; it may think it's 1-1-1970, for example. If it then attempts to validate the IP address of 'ntp.time.nl' using DNSSEC, the validation will fail. <a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&m=156102757301757&w=2">Solutions</a> for that scenario have been devised, but it remains an issue. With systems that are already (roughly) synchronised, that shouldn't be a problem.

            <div class="alert alert-dark">
              <p class="text-justify"><strong>Answer:</strong> Authenticated NTP isn't a feature of the basic (free and anonymous) public service. However, authentication based on symmetric keys is available to registered users by arrangement. If you'd like authentication, please get in touch and explain the background. We'll then decide whether we can provide the service, and whether we can do that for free (we may need to ask a modest fee). If we go ahead, certain conditions will apply. For example, we don't use an <a href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8573'>MD5 algorithm</a> for our keys. We don't think that the '<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5906">autokey</a>' protocol is <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8633#section-4.2">secure enough</a>, either.

          <p class="text-justify">
            TimeNL from SIDN Labs is a stratum 1 NTP service based on multiple very precise atomic reference clocks. Our server is synchronised not only with the <a href="https://www.gps.gov/">American GPS system</a>, but also with the <a href="https://www.gsa.europa.eu/european-gnss/galileo/galileo-european-global-satellite-based-navigation-system">European Galileo GNSS</a>. Unlike many other NTP services, we are not therefore fully dependent on an American system. As a first backup, we also synchronise with the <a href="https://www.ptb.de/cms/en/ptb/fachabteilungen/abt4/fb-44/ag-442/dissemination-of-legal-time/dcf77.html">German DCF077 radio signal</a>. And as a second backup, we synchronise with atomic clocks in the Netherlands (including the <a href="https://www.vsl.nl/en/technologies/time-and-frequency">VSL atomic clock in Delft</a>) <!-- TODO toevoegen UTC(VSL) --> and in Belgium as well. Our hardware automatically ensures that the most accurate reference clock is always chosen. (For enthusiasts: we use the <a href="https://www.meinbergglobal.com/english/360/#ims-lantime-m3000">M3000 from Meinberg</a>, which we affectionately call "Arnold", after the maker and nickname of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Belville">Ruth Belville</a>'s silver pocket watch.) Our server is accessible over a good (multi-homed) internet connection, using either IPv4 or IPv6. We are therefore able to offer very precise time synchronisation to a large number of users. Of course, we are already making plans for the future. We intend to increase the number of NTP servers, if we think that will increase the reliability of our service. We may also enable access via BGP anycast, as we did with the DNS servers for the .nl domain.
